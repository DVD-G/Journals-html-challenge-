<h2>1st Journal</h2>
<p>The way I will prioritze is by knowing what actions or decisions /choices will have the most positive/negative consequences. I need to know what exactly will affect my life the most.<br> 
   I need to know if the decisions I make will change my life in any significant way. The most important things in my life right now are my education and my mental status. My priority <br>
   I need to know how to not get affected by what my peers say of me and by what I think of myself. Even though my proffesional carrer will ask a lot of me. I need to face my fears. I <br>
   I have to do my best every step of the way. the way I will do this is by developing new habits/strategies that will help me know what I I can do, and What I can accomplish. 1st, for<br>
   education, I need to develop new and better study habits and I need to put things in a list: What will take me the longest to actually finish? What is the hardest decision I have to<br>
   make? What exactly is the problem that I need to solve? Why am I doing this? Why did I choose to make this a possibility in my life? Waht am I trying to accomplish? What is my end -<br>
   game plan going to look like? Once I'm able to answer these questions, I will be able to tackle any obstacle that comes my way. I need to know how to beat the system. If I didn't have<br>
   a clue of what to do, where would I be now? I need to focus on the impact of my choices will offer me. If I get the consequences that I didn't intend on gettin, I have to do as follows,<br>
   "keep moving forward." I've let my emotions dictate my decsions for too long now. I need to take action and know what needs to be done. As for my mental status, I have a lot to work <br>
   I haven't always been like this, I remember times when I had the illusion of being happy. I wish I could savor the sweet moments I had as a child. I wish could go back. But now is <br>
   not the time to be nostalgaic, now is the time to live inthe moment I am living in right now. Yes, I am aware that our lives will always be susceptible to change: there is no <br>
   altering that part of life. I need to be ready with whatever comes my way. I can't let my condition worsen over time. By the way, If I do let it get worse, I think I will go insane.<br>
   I know it can be scary to sometimes take action, but I have to do it. If I actually want to be happy, Ihave to know what my priorities are for accomplishing that specific goal. Both<br>
   my education and social life are depleting my mental, physical, emotional, spiritual, and cognotive abilities. Everyone I know has taken notice of it, I am not the same person anymore.<br>
   I hope that by the end these ten weeks at Tx, I am able to prioritize what exactly will bring me the most happiness/success or the most sadness/faliure. I really want to be a software<br>
   engineer at Google, or more specifically, Facebook. I want to be successful, Iwant to be able to provide for my family, etc.</p>

<h2>2nd Journal</h2>
<p>I think the reason we are told to memorize the creed is to have a guide on how to be successful in the TxT program. It gives us a glimpse of how things are going to work at TxT and how<br>
   it will change you as a person. You need to follow these in order to become part of the TxT family. Like the activities that we had to do in the past hour, the credd helps us develop <br>
   a unique critical thinking process so we can have selfp-disciplin, and success. These past few activities like the light bulb project and the birthday activity have been somewhat rough<br>
   because we didn't follow the creed. The creed lets us meet certain expectations that are needed in order to succeed. I honestly felt scaredd and confused doing these activities because<br>
   of how new and sudden they seemed to me. I followed the creed. I don't think I would've felt the way I just did right now. The creed tells us of what to expect from the activities that<br>
   will be assigned to us inthis program. If there were more activities as rigorous as these I will make sure to follow the creed.</p>
